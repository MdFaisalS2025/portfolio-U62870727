## Overview

This site was created for **Assignment 2 — Programming with AI**. It showcases:
- **About**: short intro in your voice
- **Academic Projects**: at least two showcased (this site includes five)
- **Skills**: tools, frameworks, and strengths
- **Experience & Education**: concise timeline/cards
- **Contact**: email, LinkedIn, GitHub

The design demonstrates CSS experimentation (colors, gradients, animation, and glassmorphism) while keeping accessibility and readability in mind.

## AI Usage
I used AI tools for palette ideas, copy refinement, and small markup patterns, then reviewed and edited everything for accuracy and originality.
